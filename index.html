    <p>
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[5] native to south central China.<p/>
<p>[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, <p/>
    <p>over the ears, and across its round body. <p/>
<p>  The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda.<p/>
<p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[6]<p/>
